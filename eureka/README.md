# eureka
* Nothing fancy!
* Multiple server and client projects are presented
* Both clients have single rest controller classes and are able to call other client's methods
* Servers run on ports 8011 and 8012, clients run on ports 7001 and 7002


## Future Work
* Move eureka server urls to spring cloud config
